# Getting started

In this hands-on exercise, two R packages will be used. They are:

- sf for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data, and
- tidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)
```

# importing polygon feature data in shapefile format
The code chunk below uses st_read() function of sf package to import MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile into R as a polygon feature data frame. Note that when the input geospatial data is in shapefile format, two arguments will be used, namely: dsn to define the data path and layer to provide the shapefile name. Also note that no extension such as .shp, .dbf, .prj and .shx are needed.

```{r}
mpsz = st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                  layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```
